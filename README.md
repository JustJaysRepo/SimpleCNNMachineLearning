# SimpleCNNMachineLearning
# Simple CNN Project

This repository contains a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project implemented in Python. The goal of this project is to classify images from a dataset and demonstrate the use of CNNs for image recognition tasks.

---

## Features
- Implementation of a simple CNN using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Training and testing on an image dataset.
- Visualization of model accuracy and loss over epochs.
- Prediction on new images to evaluate model performance.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following libraries are installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas (optional, if your dataset uses CSVs)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the `.ipynb` file)

##Future Improvements
- •	Add data augmentation to improve model generalization.
- •	Implement advanced architectures such as ResNet or VGG.
-	•	Include hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
-	•	Use a larger or more diverse dataset for training.
- •	Use a custom dataset for training.
- •	SCALE.
